        <h1>Timeless</h1>
        <p>One day, two star-crossed lovers met.</p>
        <p>He was a scientist, she was a teacher.</p>
        <p>Together, they made a shining star.</p>
        <p>A daughter.</p>
        <p>She brought tons of joy to their lives.</p>
        <p>One day, the two lovers mysteriously split apart.</p>
        <p>Neither wanted to see the other ever again.</p>
        <p>Custody was granted to the father, and life continued.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <h2>5 YEARS LATER...</h2>
        <p>The star's bright light went out.</p>
        <p>The daughter died.</p>
        <p>The father, driven by greif, started working on a machine.</p>
        <p>The machine's purpose was to bring his daughter back.</p>
        <p>But it failed.</p>
        <p>He saw too much.</p>
        <p>He was driven mad.</p>
        <p>He is now ruler over an army of creatures who have been brainwashed to bring chaos and tyranny to these fair lands.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>"Nikolas"...</p>
        <p>"Ed"...</p>
        <p>"Susie"...</p>
        <p>"Sam"...</p>
        <p>Save him.</p>
        <p>Bring peace to the world.</p>
        <p>Only you four have this power.</p>
        <p>Use it wisely.</p>
